<h1> A machine learning algorithm, which is able to predict if a customer will buy again</h1>
Given a data from an Audiobook app. Logically, it relates only to the audio versions of books.
Each customer in the database has made a purchase at least once, that's why he/she is in the database. We want to create a machine learning algorithm based on our available data that can predict if a customer will buy again from the Audiobook company.
